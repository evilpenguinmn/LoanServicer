This project is licensed under the GPL (see the LICENSE file for details).

This purpose of this project is to produce a GUI application that can be used
to originate and track the status of a loan and its repayment.

This isn't for banks (who will all have such software already), although if you
are a bank, by all means, feel free to use this code subject to the terms of
the GPL. We developed it to track a Contract for Deed, and we thought many
others out there might be able to use such an application.
